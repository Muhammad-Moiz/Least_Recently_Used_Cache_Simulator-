# Least_Recently_Used_Cache_Simulator-
Computer Architecture Project
An LRU cache is an efficient cache data structure that can be used to figure out what we should evict when the cache is full.  The goal is to remove always the least-recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache.
